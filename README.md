# Data Structures and Algorithms in Python
As a software engineer using Python, I find myself neglecting CS fundamentals in
favor of standard library and imports. In a professional environment, this is
justifiable; Why reinvent the wheel when well-constructed, well-tested, and
optimized olutions already exist.

Since CS fundamentals like data strcctures and algorithms are a perishable skill,
I thought it wise to brush them off and practice a bit more. At the very least,
it gives me a warm and fuzzy that I know how the library I imported works under
the hood.
